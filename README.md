# Rust-VECTOR

During January 2025, I worked as a team member of a project group whose goal was to implement the [InterSystems $VECTOR](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=RCOS_fvector) data type in Rust. This was an unpaid internship through Tufts but I worked with an Intersystems developer on the project.

The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Tufts-University/rust/blob/main/vector_implementation.rs). You will need to login using a Tufts account.
